## Learning Objectives

* Learn how to debug a java application along with basic java syntax
* Learn how to write a single java class 
* Practice testing using JUnit tests
* Be able to answer some introductory questions about java syntax and object oriented design
* Write a UML diagram for a java application
* Learn about git and github 
* Learn how to use gradescope combined with github for homework submission

An observant reader will notice that many of the learning objectives have very little to do with the code itself. This is intentional. The goal of this assignment is to get you comfortable with the homework submission process, and to get your "ecosystem" setup for this class. Just as importantly, this classes focuses heavily on industrial practices, and we want to get you comfortable with the tools you will be using in the industry. Github and Markdown are both tools heavily used in industry, so we will be using for all our assignments.
