# Homework Aloha World Report

The following report contains questions you need to answer as part of your submission for the homework assignment. 


## Design Doc
Please link your UML design file here. See resources in the assignment on how to
link an image in markdown. You may also use [mermaid] class diagrams if you prefer, is so, include the mermaid code here.  You DO NOT have to include Greeting.java as part of the diagram, just the AlohaWorld application that includes: [AlohaWorld.java], [Greeter.java], and [ConsoleView.java].





## Assignment Questions

1. List three java syntax items you didn't know when reading the code.  (make sure to use * for the list items, see example below, the backtick marks are used to write code inline with markdown)
   
   * `public final class AlohaWorld`

2. For each syntax item listed above, explain what it does in your own words and then link a resource where you figured out what it does in the references section. 

    * The `final` keyword when used on a class prevents the class from being subclassed. This means that the class cannot be extended by another class. This is useful when you want to prevent a class from being modified or extended[^1].
